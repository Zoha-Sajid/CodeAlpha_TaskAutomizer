File Organizer ðŸ“‚âœ¨ This program sorts files into folders based on their extensions, keeping your data organized. It scans a source folder, creates necessary subfolders (e.g., "Text_Files", "Images"), and moves files accordingly. Saves time and ensures a neat folder structure automatically! ðŸš€
