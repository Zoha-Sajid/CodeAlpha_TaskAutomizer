**File Organizer - Automated File Sorting** ðŸ“‚âœ¨  

 **Overview**  
This Python program automates the process of sorting files into different folders based on their extensions. It helps maintain an organized file structure by moving files into designated folders, making data management easier and more efficient.  

 **How It Works**  
The script follows these steps to organize your files:  
1. **Scans the source folder** and lists all the files.  
2. **Identifies each file's extension** (e.g., `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`).  
3. **Creates corresponding folders** (e.g., `Text_Files`, `Images`, `PDF_Files`) if they donâ€™t exist.  
4. **Moves files** into their respective folders based on their extension.  
5. **Displays messages** to track progress and confirm completion.  

 **Why Use This Program?**  
âœ… **Automates** file sorting, saving time and effort.  
âœ… **Prevents clutter** by organizing files systematically.  
âœ… **Customizable** to support additional file extensions.  
âœ… **Easy to use**â€”just run the script and let it do the work!  

 **Supported File Types**  
The program currently supports the following file types and organizes them into corresponding folders:  

--------------------------------------
| File Type           | Folder Name  |
|---------------------|------------- |
| `.txt`              | Text_Files   |
| `.jpg, .jpeg, .png` | Images       |
| `.pdf`              | PDF_Files    |
| `.docx`             | Word_Files   |
| `.xlsx`             | Excel_Files  |
| `.mp3`              | Audio_Files  |
--------------------------------------

You can easily modify the script to add more file types.  

 **How to Use**  
 **1. Install Python**  
Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).  

 **2. Run the Script**  
1. **Edit the `source_folder` path** in the `main()` function to match the folder you want to organize.  
2. Open **Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)** and navigate to the scriptâ€™s location.  
3. Run the script using:  
   ```bash
   python file_organizer.py
   ```  
4. The program will sort your files and display progress messages.  

 **Customization**  
- To add more file types, update the `extensions_folders` dictionary in the script.  
- Change the destination folder structure as per your preference.
